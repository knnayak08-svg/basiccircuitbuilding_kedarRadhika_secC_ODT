Our Model is an internally curcuitry model of a robot's face. With a pencil led acting as a key, the circuit is complete, hence lighting up the eyes in case of a "happy" scenario, and lighting up the eyes and the buzzer in case of an "angry scenario.
Functioning is simple. The circuit comprises of a cell, LEDs, a buzzer, and wires to connect them all. The LEDs are connected in parallel to put less pressure of the cell, which provides just 3V power in comparison to the 1.7V LED. Hence, a series arrangement is not possible.With the introduction of the buzzer, it is also arranged in parallel.
The connection is open between the negative end of the cell, and the negative end of the parallel connection. The bridge is made using the led of a pencil, being the "key".
